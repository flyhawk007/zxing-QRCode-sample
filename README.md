### ZXing ("Zebra Crossing")  
ZXing (pronounced "zebra crossing") is an open-source  
multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java  
with ports to other languages.  
Our focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to scan and decode barcodes on the device  
without communicating with a server.  
However the project can be used to encode and decode barcodes on desktops and servers as well.  
We currently support these formats:  

・UPC-A and UPC-E  
・EAN-8 and EAN-13  
・Code 39  
・Code 93  
・Code 128  
・ITF  
・Codabar  
・RSS-14 (all variants)  
・RSS Expanded (most variants)  
・QR Code  
・Data Matrix  
・Aztec ('beta' quality)  
・PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)
